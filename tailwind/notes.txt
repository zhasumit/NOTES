npm i -D tailwind : install tailwind as dev dependency 
npx tailwind init : to initialise the tailwind config file 


then change the tailwind.config.js with content as HTML CSS JS for constant watches 
then we use certain bundlers that to accumulate all code at once, then watch that on some port


npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch : to watch the files in src 
all the previous css is nullified to be like p tag and resented 

tailwind CLI that is installed takes all and writes the CSS in output file
