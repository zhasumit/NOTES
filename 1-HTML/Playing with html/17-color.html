    <h1 style="color: rgb(54, 153, 51); font-size: 800;">What is Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA)?</h1>
    <p style="color: aqua; font-size: 600;">
        Data structure and algorithms is a branch of computer science that deals with creating
        machine-efficient and optimized computer programs. The term Data Structure refers to the
        storage and organization of data, and Algorithm refers to the step by step procedure to
        solve a problem. By combining "data structure" and "algorithm", we optimize the codes in
        software engineering.

        For those who are from non-technical backgrounds, they can also learn the techniques used in
        the algorithms for solving their daily problems. Furthermore, one cannot neglect the importance
        of DSA in any programming language. DSA never gets extinct, rather it is evolving because the
        evolving computers, in the 21st century, need evolving algorithms to solve a complex problem.
        <br> Not to mention, a programmer should know how to use an appropriate data structure in the right algorithm.
